One spring, at an hour of an unprecedented hot sunset, two citizens appeared in Moscow, at the Patriarch's Ponds. The first of them, dressed in a gray summer pair, was short, chubby, bald, carried his decent hat with a pie in his hand, and on his well-shaven face were placed supernatural-sized glasses in black horn-rimmed frames. The second - a broad-shouldered, reddish, fluffy young man in a checkered cap tucked at the back of his head - was in a cowboy shirt, chewed-up white trousers and black slippers. The first was none other than Mikhail Aleksandrovich Berlioz, chairman of the board of one of the largest Moscow literary associations, abbreviated as MASSOLIT, and editor of a thick art magazine, and his young companion is the poet Ivan Nikolayevich Ponyrev, who writes under the pseudonym Bezdomny.
Having fallen into the shade of slightly green lindens, the writers rushed to the brightly painted booth with the inscription "Beer and Water".
Yes, the first strangeness of this terrible May evening should be noted. Not only at the booth, but in the entire alley parallel to Malaya Bronnaya Street, there was not a single person. At that hour, when it seemed that there was no strength to breathe, when the sun, heating Moscow, fell in a dry fog somewhere beyond the Garden Ring - no one came under the linden trees, no one sat down on the bench, the alley was empty.
- Give the narzan, - asked Berlioz.
- Narzan is not there, - answered the woman in the booth and for some reason was offended.
- Do you have beer? - Homeless inquired in a hoarse voice.
“The beer will be delivered in the evening,” the woman replied.
- What is there? Asked Berlioz.
“Apricot, only warm,” the woman said.
- Well, come on, come on, come on! ..
Apricot gave a rich yellow foam, and the air smelled of a barber shop. After getting drunk, the writers immediately began to hiccup, paid off and sat down on a bench facing the pond and with their backs to Bronnaya.
Then the second oddity happened, concerning Berlioz alone. He suddenly stopped hiccuping, his heart beat and for a moment sank somewhere, then came back, but with a blunt needle stuck in him. In addition, Berlioz was seized by an unfounded, but so strong fear that he wanted to immediately flee from the Patriarchs without looking back. Berlioz looked around sadly, not understanding what had frightened him. He turned pale, wiped his forehead with a handkerchief, thought: “What is wrong with me? It never happened ... my heart is naughty ... I'm overtired. Perhaps it's time to throw everything to hell and to Kislovodsk ... "
And then the sultry air thickened in front of him, and a transparent citizen of a strange appearance was woven from this air. On a small head there is a jockey cap, a checkered kurgozny airy jacket ... A citizen is a fathom tall, but narrow at the shoulders, incredibly thin, and the physiognomy, please note, is mocking.
Berlioz's life developed in such a way that he was not used to extraordinary phenomena. Even paler, he goggled his eyes and in confusion thought: "This cannot be! .." But, alas, it was, and a long, through which you can see the citizen, without touching the ground, swayed in front of him both to the left and to the right.
Here terror seized Berlioz to such an extent that he closed his eyes. And when he opened them, he saw that everything was over, the haze dissolved, the checkered one disappeared, and at the same time the dull needle jumped out of the heart.
- Fu you devil! - exclaimed the editor, - you know, Ivan, I just barely had a stroke from the heat! There was even something like a hallucination. ”He tried to grin, but anxiety was still leaping in his eyes, and his hands were trembling.
However, he gradually calmed down, fanned himself with a handkerchief and, uttering quite cheerfully: "Well, so ..." - he made a speech, interrupted by a drink of apricot.
This speech, as they later learned, was about Jesus Christ. The fact is that the editor ordered the poet for the next book of the magazine a large anti-religious poem. Ivan Nikolaevich composed this poem, and in a very short time, but, unfortunately, the editor was not at all satisfied with it. Homeless outlined the main character of his poem, that is, Jesus, in very black colors, and nevertheless, according to the editor, the whole poem had to be written anew. And now the editor was giving the poet a kind of lecture on Jesus in order to highlight the poet's fundamental mistake. It's hard to say what exactly let Ivan d
Nikolaevich - whether the pictorial power of his talent or complete ignorance of the issue on which he was going to write - but Jesus in his image turned out well, just like a living, although not attractive character. Berlioz wanted to prove to the poet that the main thing is not what Jesus was like, whether he was bad or good, but that this Jesus, as a person, did not exist at all in the world and that all the stories about him are simple inventions, the most common myth.
It should be noted that the editor was a well-read man and very skillfully pointed in his speech to ancient historians, for example, the famous Philo of Alexandria, the brilliantly educated Joseph Flavius, who never mentioned a word about the existence of Jesus. Discovery of solid erudition, Mikhail Alexandrovich told the poet, among other things, that that place is in the 15th book, in chapter 44 of the famous Tacitus "Annals", which says
